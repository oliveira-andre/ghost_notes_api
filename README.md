# Ghost Notes API

> this message will be placed in both projects the `client` and `api`

```
This project was created thinking in some examples like anonfiles, ghostbin, pastebin etc...
i love to create ghost notes and we never can be sure of a project until read the code, then i started this
project to encrypt all notes to be sure that no one instead of you will access the information that you saved
